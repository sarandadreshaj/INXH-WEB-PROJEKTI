                <p>>The Wordery story begins with five friends. Between them, they’ve worked in the book trade for more than 40 years
                     and all share a passion for reading.

                <p>They believed that online retail had diminished the enjoyment of buying books, that it had lost its soul.
                     So they decided to recapture its spirit with an ambitious venture to establish an online bookshop.

                </div>
                <p>A place where booklovers could discover new reads and chat to helpful staff with a genuine enthusiasm 
                    for all things bound. It would, in short, be like a traditional bookshop. But with all the convenience of 
                    an online store: great service, an outstanding choice, round-the-clock access, excellent value, and 
                    – of course – free delivery to anywhere in the world.

                <p>We’ve grown a lot since 2012. The initial team of five has expanded to 25, we process more than 25,000
                    orders on a busy day and have five million customers in over 100 countries. Despite our increased size,
                    our passion for what we do remains the same. We want to share our love of reading with the rest of the world.
                    For example, we’re committed to working with charities to improve literacy among young people, because we 
                    believe this is a crucial measure of a healthy society. We partner with national literacy charities and a
                    local primary school to engender a love of reading among pupils. It’s proving a real success, and many 
                    children have discovered a love of literature.</p>

                <p>Never content with the status quo, we continue to innovate and grow Wordery globally. We always want to offer 
                    the widest possible range of books online, naturally. Currently offering over 10 million different titles, 
                    we are constantly on the lookout for new partners so that we can increase that figure.
                    We work closely with publishers, suppliers and authors to make sure you’ll always find the book you want
                    when you come to our online store. And as well as giving you all the choice you could wish for, you can
                    rest assured that delivery will always be completely free – wherever you’re located.</p>

                <p>We believe that bookstores are essential to a healthy culture. They’re where authors can connect with readers,
                    where we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of reading that can last a lifetime.
                    They’re also anchors for our downtowns and communities. As more and more people buy their books online,
                     we wanted to create an easy, convenient way for you to get your books and support bookstores at the same time.</p>

                <p>Some people like to read on a screen. Other people need the variety and artistry, the sight, smell, and feel of actual
                    books.They love seeing them on their shelves; they love having shelves for them.
                    They love taking them along when they leave the house, and stacking them by their bedsides. They love finding old
                    letters and bookmarks in them. They like remembering where they bought them or who they received them from.
                    They want to read in a way that offers a rich experience, more than the words only: the full offering of a book. 
                    They are particular about covers, they want to surround themselves with the poetry of good design.

                    They can't pass a bookstore without going in and getting something, they keep a library card and use it.</p>

                <p>They are allergic to cheap bestsellers; they delight in the out-of-the-way and the rare, the well-made and the
                    hard-to-accomplish. They take care of their books; they  know a book is only theirs until it passes on to someone
                    else. They are good stewards of a timeless object.
