        <h2><b>Description</b></h2>
        <p class="description">Philippa Taylor (Pepper to her friends) has big dreams. When she closes her eyes, she can picture 
            exactly who she ought to be. The problem is, it's about as far away from her real life in a small coastal town in Suffolk 
            as she can imagine. So when her elderly friend Josephine persuades Pepper to accompany her on a trip to Europe, she jumps 
            at the chance to change her routine. And when Pepper bumps (literally) into the handsome Finn in Lisbon, it seems as though
            she might have finally found what she's been looking for. But Pepper know all too well things are rarely as they seem. Her
            own quiet life hides a dark secret from the past. And even though she and Finn may have been destined to find each other, 
            Pepper suspects life may have other plans as to how the story should end.
            A romantic and sweeping story about friendship, love and realising that sometimes it's about the journey, not the destination.
