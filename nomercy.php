        <h2><b>Description</b></h2>
        <p class="description">Diana Davies is head of the family business.
            She’s a woman in a man’s world, but no one messes with her. Her only son, Angus, is a natural born villain, but he needs 
            to earn Diana’s trust before he gets his place in the business.
            Once he’s proved he has the brains to run their clubs in Marbella, his reign of terror knows no bounds.
            But Angus has a weakness: his wife, Lorna, and their three kids. And as the next generation enters the business, 
            Angus must learn a painful truth. Even when it comes to family, show no mercy.
